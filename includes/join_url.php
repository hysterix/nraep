/**
 * This function joins together URL components to form a complete URL.
 *
 * RFC3986 specifies the components of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
 * This function implements the specification's "component recomposition"
 * algorithm for combining URI components into a full URI string.
 *
 * The $parts argument is an associative array containing zero or
 * more of the following:
 *
 *	"scheme"	The scheme, such as "http".
 *	"host"		The host name, IPv4, or IPv6 address.
 *	"port"		The port number.
 *	"user"		The user name.
 *	"pass"		The user password.
 *	"path"		The path, such as a file path for "http".
 *	"query"		The query.
 *	"fragment"	The fragment.
 *
 * The "port", "user", and "pass" values are only used when a "host"
 * is present.
 *
 * The optional $encode argument indicates if appropriate URL components
 * should be percent-encoded as they are assembled into the URL.  Encoding
 * is only applied to the "user", "pass", "host" (if a host name, not an
 * IP address), "path", "query", and "fragment" components.  The "scheme"
 * and "port" are never encoded.  When a "scheme" and "host" are both
 * present, the "path" is presumed to be hierarchical and encoding
 * processes each segment of the hierarchy separately (i.e., the slashes
 * are left alone).
 *
 * The assembled URL string is returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	parts		an associative array of strings containing the
 * 			individual parts of a URL.
 *
 * 	encode		an optional boolean flag selecting whether
 * 			to do percent encoding or not.  Default = true.
 *
 * Return values:
 * 	Returns the assembled URL string.  The string is an absolute
 * 	URL if a scheme is supplied, and a relative URL if not.  An
 * 	empty string is returned if the $parts array does not contain
 * 	any of the needed values.
