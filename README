Requirements:
 apache, php, curl

Reason:
	Because sometimes mothersfuckers need to get spammed.

What:
	Nraep goes through a list of web-site url's that contain newsletter sign up forums.
	The sites have been (hopefully) preselected for ease of sign up which entails:
	 - no captchas
	 - no redirects
	 - no cookies (that are required for submitting a form)
	 - no javascript submits

	Adding links to the list with these things won't really do much except slow down your execution time for working url's, so don't do it!
	Nraep does not follow links, so putting home-pages that do not have forms directly on them is useless.
	
	This is just to 'sign up' for a newsletter, in the sense that the person may be signed up fully, or get an e-mail to confirm the response.  	    		They may not necessarily be signed up on the newsletter after using nraep if there is an opt-in, but those sites without a confirm opt-in do.

How:
	The default list currently signs up to a nigger-tits number of newsletters.  It gives about a 50% false positive success rate currently, so don't 	  be deceived by the pretty numbers.  This will be fixed in later versions

	Site list:
		The site list is currently an array inside the file includes/list.php file, and holds the spam list url's appropriated from partyvan 			(thanks!).  Hopefully this list will get epically large soon.

Notes:
	nraep supports curls multi-threading abilities in that you can set the maximum number of connections to be whatever you think your server 		and memory can handle.  Ten is the most efficient for me; and probably just fine for most, but edit the config.php if you want to up this amount.

	hysterix offically hax0rd hidemyass.com.  Now nraep fully supports connecting to the target newsletter through a proxy instead of a direct 	 	 connection.  It will take a bit before a good proxy is found and cached, and you might pass over a few newsletters in the list during this time.
	After a good proxy is found, the rest of the connections will most likely be successful, so simply be patient.  This is implemented through 
	'ghetto tables'; a simple check of the hash of the image (port) compared to a premade lookup yields ports they thought were "hidden" to bots!
	More info inside includes/proxy.php

	nraep will cycle randomly through the user-agent string list set inside includes/config.php and won't reuse this between websites so if you using
	this with a proxy you should be concealed fairly well.

	nreap has a "stealth logging mode" which just means the ip address of the person using nreap is not logged (in the app itself). The default
	is off, as I'd imagine most people would want to see the ip's connecting and using the app. (Should be using browser proxy if on a remote server 	 anyways).

Todo:
	- a fuckton!
	- put together even larger, more epic spam newsletter list
	- 'remainder' of sites, if division is not even, do not execute (list count / maximum connections) <- ex. 92 / 10 = 9 loops of 10, 2 sites at the 		  end don't get executed
	- redirect/forwarding support when submitting a form
	- cookie support when submitting a form
	- javascript support when submitting a form
	- expand newsletter validation function to handle more complex forms
	- add more form fields of user information, enter your own or use defaults
	- integrate a remote xml list over-ride/side-by-side feature to grab and use multiple lists simultaneously
	- create "newsletter google dork" feature, find newsletters automagically using google = auto reap
